We are building a next-generation platform composed of autonomous microservices using modern engineering principles. We are transitioning from monolithic systems to a distributed, cloud-native ecosystem.

We are looking for a Full Stack Engineer who can think at a system level and take ownership of services end-to-end, from database design to frontend UI, ensuring they are scalable, resilient, and loosely coupled. You will work in an environment that leverages Docker and Kubernetes to simplify infrastructure and enable focus on business logic.
